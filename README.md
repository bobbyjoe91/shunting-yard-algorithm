# shunting-yard-algorithm

Algorithm for converting infix notation (the commonly used one) to postfix notation.
This algorithm can be developed further for evaluating mixed numerical expression in PEMDAS (or BODMAS) order.

Implemented in Node.js

[This link](https://www.web4college.com/converters/infix-to-postfix-prefix.php) is used as testing reference.


### Future update
- Enable unary operator, e.g: minus (-5, -1, etc)
- Enable user to evaluate the expression
